Oh, the customary hello world post. “Hello, world” was the first set of words I
typed in-between html paragraph tags when I started learning to code. I had
spent the better parts of the day manually copying every bit of information I
could find on w3schools into my notebook (an actual book and not the computer)
and by evening, I was ready to put all I had written down on paper into practice
on a real computer.

The thing was, I didn’t have a computer at the time but I had a friend who
operated a printing press business and had a computer for graphic design needs.
The computer was available for use whenever he wasn’t using it — this was mostly
in the evenings as he would have moved on to doing other things that needed his
attention so while I spent the day browsing the web on my phone and writing down
the information in my notebook, during the evenings, I would practice using my
friend’s computer.

I remember the excitement with which I used to open notepad (this is a
simple text editor on the Microsoft Windows platform) and the joy I felt when I
opened the page on internet explorer (this was a browser on the Microsoft
Windows platform 😁) to display my very first webpage and all it said was
“Hello, world!”.

My friend couldn’t understand my joy — as far as he knew, I just went through a
very cumbersome process to display some text on the screen as this was something
he could have easily done in Corel draw (the best graphics editor as far as
every printing press business on my street was concerned) or Microsoft word
(I think Google has a “clone” of this, I’m not sure, you’d have to google it)
but I understood that it was foundational and was the start of something great.

In the same vein, here is my first article which I start with the same fervor as
my first hello world program.
